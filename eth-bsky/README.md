# ens-zketh

This is a set of scripts that allow association of ENS addresses with DIDs. This happens using [atproto DIDs](atproto.com) and exposing the identifier at `/.well-known/atproto-did`.

Associations are made between ENS addresses and DIDs by verifying a signature corresponding to the ENS address.
